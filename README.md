# About
### There are two parts to this project: 
- 1. curation, exploration, and analysis of original SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase dataset
- 2. creation of model to predict iCP50 values of molecules given their molecular (fingerprint) descriptors using preexisting Acetylcholinesterase dataset
