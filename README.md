# About
### There are two parts to this project: 
- 1. curation, exploration, and analysis of original SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase dataset
- 2. creation of model to predict ICP50 values of molecules given their molecular (fingerprint) descriptors using preexisting Acetylcholinesterase dataset
---
*Note: This project is unfinished as I would like to do some further work with the model and the implications of predicting ICP50 values.*
