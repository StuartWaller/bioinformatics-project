- planned on using the SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase data, however, the dataset was too small (too few molecules to work with)
- so, in order to take the project a step further, I used a large dataset (with Acetylcholinesterase being the target protein) from Github
- then computed the molecular (fingerprint) descriptors for each molecule using PADEL-Descriptor software
- these fingerprint descriptors differ from the Lipinski descriptors: 
 - Lipinski descriptors emphasize behavior / traits of each molecule
 - fingerprint descriptors are simply the unique atomic building blocks of each molecule
- created X DataFrame of descriptors and Y DataFrame of iC50 values
